    <h4>1. What is REMEMProt? </h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    REMEMProt is a resource of proteins that are identified from distinct membrane-enriched fractions in
    diverse biological/experimental contexts using mass spectrometry in <i>Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, </i>
    and <i>Rattus norvegicus </i> systems.

    </p>

    <h4>2. Why REMEMProt? </h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Membrane proteins are a significant group of proteins that serve as cellular/tissue markers, targets for therapeutic approaches, and interaction partners/facilitators for the entry of diverse infectious agents. Researchers face a lot of challenges in choosing suitable membrane enrichment approaches to extract and subsequently, identify membrane proteins in diverse biological contexts at the global or targeted level. Mass spectrometry has evolved as a global platform for unbiased and targeted identification of proteins from any biological sample. We compiled proteins enriched by distinct membrane protein enrichment methods that were identified by mass spectrometry across multiple studies from diverse cell lines and tissues of different biological conditions. Hence, REMEMProt represents the compendium of such proteins that are identified thus far by diverse enrichment methods coupled to their identification by mass spectrometry. This resource will serve as a reference platform for the selection of suitable enrichment methods for a specific or set of proteins of choice, or for comparative analysis of proteins derived using currently available or novel membrane enrichment platforms in the future.
        We are committed to continued update, addition of sequence and structural level information in the future.  We request the support and active participation of the scientific community towards the efficient annotation of membrane proteins into REMEMProt.
    </p>


    <h4>3. What are the information available in REMEMProt?</h4>

    <p  style="text-align: justify;">REMEMProt encompasses the list of membrane proteins identified across multiple studies including both profiling and differential expression along with the method of enrichment and their cellular origin. We also provide the biological context of the identification of proteins and their other biological features. REMEMProt also facilitates disease ontology analysis.</p>

    <h4>4. How to download the REMEMProt data?</h4>

   <p  style="text-align: justify;">The data curated in REMEMProt can be searched in batches in the ‘Batch Query’ option. Please “Contact Us” if you want to access all the data at once.
</p>

<h4>5. What are the enrichment analysis facilitated by REMEMProt?</h4>

<p  style="text-align: justify;">
    The REMEMProt provides information on the organism, cellular source, disease, profiling/ differential expression, method of enrichment and biological context of identification of proteins. Currently, the REMEMProt is also enabled to batch query and enrich for a set of user query proteins based on the data in REMEMProt for the disease ontology, biological features of proteins, Gene Ontology and markers from the CellMarker database.
